**Title of the PhD thesis:**
 
 Comparison of map reading by teachers and students
 
**Motivation:**

In my Ph.D. thesis, I am investigating map reading of students and their teachers using eye-tracking
and I am comparing their reading strategies. Eye-tracking is a technology, that allows recording of the
human gaze. It is widely used in many fields of research including GIS and cartography. Eye-tracking
data is spatial-temporal data because eye movements are recorded over time in relation to space
(screen or map).

The main aim of my Ph.D. thesis is to compare eye-movement trajectories of different groups of users
- teachers and their students. I already have an experience in analyses and visualization of eye-tracking
data using V-analytics tool (space-time cube and other). It can be used for eye-tracking data as well as
for geospatial data.

## Visualization

I learned about possibilities how to visulize some kinds od data. How to do it easily and attractively. But for my reserch I need litte bit different king of visualization as scientific visualization. I need to anylyze the data not only diplay.

## Reproducibility

Reproducibility topic was much more interestig for me. Reproducibility is very importatnt. I´ll ty to put somethig of this ideas into my reseach. Firstly, I will try to write my papers as reproducible as possible.

The practical part of this topic was very interesting I hope that we will use that for management of our eye-traking data. 


## Science communication

Probably the best part of the Agile PhD school. I realized how important is to think about audience, about the whole story of the paper, what i need to say, what i need to reach, etc.It´s necessery  
I will use these ideas in my next articles.
